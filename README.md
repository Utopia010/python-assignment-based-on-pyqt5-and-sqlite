Brief Introductioin: with pyqt5 and sqlite3, there occurs a simple and ugly interface and you can log, sign, save, transfer, withdraw.
      If there are some data in example.db, you can see some reminders like data about account and some else in your console.


Usage: you can just copy experiment.py and run it, there will be a file named "example.db" as data file of sqlite if there is no bug. 
  But, I guess, it is enough for assignment if you don't write any code. 

Don't foget to download sqlite3 and else lib
